    ScanRefer: 3D Object Localization in RGB-D Scans using Natural Language
  image: Chen_ScanRefer.png
  description: >-
    This paper introduce the task of 3D object localization in RGB-D scans using natural language descriptions. As input, we assume a point cloud of a scanned 3D scene along with a free-form description of a specified target object. To address this task, we propose ScanRefer, learning a fused descriptor from 3D object proposals and encoded sentence embeddings. This fused descriptor correlates language expressions with geometric features, enabling regression of the 3D bounding box of a target object. We also introduce the ScanRefer dataset, containing 51,583 descriptions of 11,046 objects from 800 ScanNet scenes. ScanRefer is the first large-scale effort to perform object localization via natural language expression directly in 3D.

     Learning Pairwise Inter-Plane Relations for Piecewise Planar Reconstruction
  image: yimming_eccv20.png
  description: >-
     This paper proposes a novel single-image piecewise planar reconstruction technique that infers and enforces inter-plane relationships. Our approach takes a planar reconstruction result from an existing system, then utilizes convolutional neural network (CNN) to (1) classify if two planes are orthogonal or parallel; and 2) infer if two planes are touching and, if so, where in the image. We formulate an optimization problem to refine plane parameters and employ a message passing neural network to refine plane segmentation masks by enforcing the inter-plane relations. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of plane parameters and segmentation accuracy.

   House-GAN: Relational Generative Adversarial Networks for Graph-constrained House Layout Generation
  image: housegan.jpg
  description: >-
   This paper proposes a novel graph-constrained generative adversarial network, whose generator and discriminator are built upon relational architecture. The main idea is to encode the constraint into the graph structure of its relational networks. We have demonstrated the proposed architecture for a new house layout generation problem, whose task is to take an architectural constraint as a graph (i.e., the number and types of rooms with their spatial adjacency) and produce a set of axis-aligned bounding boxes of rooms. We measure the quality of generated house layouts with the three metrics: the realism, the diversity, and the compatibility with the input graph constraint. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations over 117,000 real floorplan images demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods and baselines. We will publicly share all our code and data.

   Vectorizing World Buildings: Planar Graph Reconstruction by Primitive Detection and Relationship Inference
  image: vectorize-building.jpg
  description: >-
   This paper tackles a 2D architecture vectorization problem, whose task is to infer an outdoor building architecture as a 2D planar graph from a single RGB image. We provide a new benchmark with ground-truth annotations for 2,001 complex buildings across the cities of Atlanta, Paris, and Las Vegas. We also propose a novel algorithm utilizing 1) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that detects geometric primitives and infers their relationships and 2) an integer programming (IP) that assembles the information into a 2D planar graph. While being a trivial task for human vision, the inference of a graph structure with an arbitrary topology is still an open problem for computer vision. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm makes significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art, towards an intelligent system at the level of human perception. We will share code and data.

   GANhopper: Multi-Hop GAN for Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation
  image: lira_GANH.png
  description: >-
   We introduce GANhopper, an unsupervised image-to-image translation network that transforms images gradually between two domains, through multiple hops. Instead of executing translation directly, we steer the translation by requiring the network to produce in-between images which resemble weighted hybrids between images from the two input domains. Our network is trained on unpaired images from the two domains only, without any in-between images. All hops are produced using a single generator along each direction. In addition to the standard cycle-consistency and adversarial losses, we introduce a new hybrid discriminator, which is trained to classify the intermediate images produced by the generator as weighted hybrids, with weights based on a predetermined hop count.

   DR-KFS: A Differentiable Visual Similarity Metric for 3D Shape Reconstruction
  image: jin_DRKFD.png
  description: >-
   We advocate the use of differential visual shape metrics to train deep neural networks for 3D reconstruction. We introduce such a metric which compares two 3D shapes by measuring visual, image-space differences between multiview images differentiably rendered from the shapes. Furthermore, we develop a differentiable image-space distance based on mean-squared errors defined over HardNet features computed from probabilistic keypoint maps of the compared images. Our differential visual shape metric can be easily plugged into various reconstruction networks, replacing the object-space distortion measures, such as Chamfer or Earth Mover distances, so as to optimize the network weights to produce reconstruction results with better structural fidelity and visual quality.

   SAPIEN: a SimulAted Part-based Interactive ENvironment

  description: >-
   Building home assistant robots has long been a pursuit for vision and robotics researchers. To achieve this task, a simulated environment with physically realistic simulation, sufficient articulated objects, and transferability to the real robot is indispensable. Existing environments achieve these requirements for robotics simulation with different levels of simplification and focus. We take one step further in constructing an environment that supports household tasks for training robot learning algorithm. Our work, SAPIEN, is a realistic and physics-rich simulated environment that hosts a large-scale set for articulated objects. Our SAPIEN enables various robotic vision and interaction tasks that require detailed part-level understanding.We evaluate stateof-the-art vision algorithms for part detection and motion attribute recognition as well as demonstrate robotic interaction tasks using heuristic approaches and reinforcement learning algorithms. We hope that our SAPIEN can open a lot of research directions yet to be explored, including learning cognition through interaction, part motion discovery, and construction of robotics-ready simulated game environment.

   DD-PPO: Learning Near-Perfect PointGoal Navigators from 2.5 Billion Frames
  image: erik_dd_ppo.png
  description: >-
   We present Decentralized Distributed Proximal Policy Optimization (DD-PPO), a method for distributed reinforcement learning in resource-intensive simulated environments. DD-PPO is distributed (uses multiple machines), decentralized (lacks a centralized server), and synchronous (no computation is ever ‘stale’), making it conceptually simple and easy to implement. In our experiments on training virtual robots to navigate in Habitat-Sim (Savva et al., 2019), DD-PPO exhibits near-linear scaling – achieving a speedup of 107x on 128 GPUs over a serial implementation. We leverage this scaling to train an agent for 2.5 Billion steps of experience (the equivalent of 80 years of human experience) – over 6 months of GPU-time training in under 3 days of wall-clock time with 64 GPUs. This massive-scale training not only sets the state of art on Habitat Autonomous Navigation Challenge 2019, but essentially ‘solves’ the task – near-perfect autonomous navigation in an unseen environment without access to a map, directly from an RGB-D camera and a GPS+Compass sensor. Fortuitously, error vs computation exhibits a power-law-like distribution; thus, 90% of peak performance is obtained relatively early (at 100 million steps) and relatively cheaply (under 1 day with 8 GPUs). Finally, we show that the scene understanding and navigation policies learned can be transferred to other navigation tasks – the analog of ‘ImageNet pre-training + task-specific fine-tuning’ for embodied AI. Our model outperforms ImageNet pre-trained CNNs on these transfer tasks and can serve as a universal resource (all models and code are publicly available).

   Are We Making Real Progress in Simulated Environments? Measuring the Sim2Real Gap in Embodied Visual Navigation
  image: kadian_simulated_environments.png
  description: >-
   Does progress in simulation translate to progress in robotics? Specifically, if method A outperforms method B in simulation, how likely is the trend to hold in reality on a robot? We examine this question for embodied (PointGoal) navigation – developing engineering tools and a research paradigm for evaluating a simulator by its sim2real predictivity, revealing surprising findings about prior work. First, we develop Habitat-PyRobot Bridge (HaPy), a library for seamless execution of identical code on a simulated agent and a physical robot. Habitat-to-Locobot transfer with HaPy involves just one line change in a config parameter, essentially treating reality as just another simulator! Second, we investigate sim2real predictivity of HabitatSim [1] for PointGoal navigation. We 3D-scan a physical lab space to create a virtualized replica, and run parallel tests of 9 different models in reality and simulation. We present a new metric called Sim-vs-Real Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) to quantify sim2real predictivity. Our analysis reveals several important findings. We find that SRCC for Habitat as used for the CVPR19 challenge is low (0.18 for the success metric), which suggests that performance improvements for this simulator-based challenge would not transfer well to a physical robot. We find that this gap is largely due to AI agents learning to ‘cheat’ by exploiting simulator imperfections – specifically, the way Habitat allows for ‘sliding’ along walls on collision. Essentially, the virtual robot is capable of cutting corners, leading to unrealistic shortcuts through parts of non-navigable space. Naturally, such exploits do not work in the real world where the robot stops on contact with walls. Our experiments show that it is possible to optimize simulation parameters to enable robots trained in imperfect simulators to generalize learned skills to reality (e.g. improving SRCCSucc from 0.18 to 0.844).

   Relational Graph Learning for Crowd Navigation
  image: changan_crowd_navigation.png
  description: >-
   We present a relational graph learning approach for robotic crowd navigation using model-based deep reinforcement learning that plans actions by looking into the future. Our approach reasons about the relations between all agents based on their latent features and uses a Graph Convolutional Network to encode higher-order interactions in each agent’s state representation, which is subsequently leveraged for state prediction and value estimation. The ability to predict human motion allows us to perform multi-step lookahead planning, taking into account the temporal evolution of human crowds. We evaluate our approach against a state-of-the-art baseline for crowd navigation and ablations of our model to demonstrate that navigation with our approach is more efficient, results in fewer collisions, and avoids failure cases involving oscillatory and freezing behaviors.

   TilinGNN: Learning to Tile with Self-Supervised Graph Neural Network
  image: xu_tiling.png
  description: >-
   We introduce the first neural optimization framework to solve a classical instance of the tiling problem. Namely, we seek a non-periodic tiling of an arbitrary 2D shape using one or more types of tiles: the tiles maximally fill the shape’s interior without overlaps or holes. To start, we reformulate tiling as a graph problem by modeling candidate tile locations in the target shape as graph nodes and connectivity between tile locations as edges. We build a graph convolutional neural network, coined TilinGNN, to progressively propagate and aggregate features over graph edges and predict tile placements. Our network is self-supervised and trained by maximizing the tiling coverage on target shapes, while avoiding overlaps and holes between the tiles. After training, TilinGNN has a running time that is roughly linear to the number of candidate tile locations, significantly outperforming traditional combinatorial search.

  description: >-
   We introduce a learning framework for automated floorplan generation which combines generative modeling using deep neural networks and user-in-the-loop designs to enable human users to provide sparse design constraints. Such constraints are represented by a layout graph. The core component of our learning framework is a deep neural network, Graph2Plan, which is trained on RPLAN, a large-scale dataset consisting of 80K annotated, human-designed floorplans. The network converts a layout graph, along with a building boundary, into a floorplan that fulfills both the layout and boundary constraints.

Starting with an initial population of 3D objects belonging to one or more functional categories, we evolve the shapes through part re-combination to produce generations of hybrids or crossbreeds between parents from the heterogeneous shape collection ...

   BSP-Net: Generating Compact Meshes via Binary Space Partitioning
  image: chen_BSPNET.png
  description: >-
   Polygonal meshes are ubiquitous in the digital 3D domain, yet they have only played a minor role in the deep learning revolution. Leading methods for learning generative models of shapes rely on implicit functions, and generate meshes only after expensive iso-surfacing routines. To overcome these challenges, we are inspired by a classical spatial data structure from computer graphics, Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), to facilitate 3D learning. The core ingredient of BSP is an operation for recursive subdivision of space to obtain convex sets. By exploiting this property, we devise BSP-Net, a network that learns to represent a 3D shape via convex decomposition. Importantly, BSP-Net is unsupervised since no convex shape decompositions are needed for training. The network is trained to reconstruct a shape using a set of convexes obtained from a BSP-tree built on a set of planes. The convexes inferred by BSP-Net can be easily extracted to form a polygon mesh, without any need for iso-surfacing. The generated meshes are compact (i.e., low-poly) and well suited to represent sharp geometry; they are guaranteed to be watertight and can be easily parameterized. We also show that the reconstruction quality by BSP-Net is competitive with state-of-the-art methods while using much fewer primitives.

   Conv-MPN: Convolutional Message Passing Neural Network for Structured Outdoor Architecture Reconstruction
  image: nelson_cvpr20.png
  description: >-
   This paper proposes a novel message passing neural (MPN) architecture Conv-MPN, which reconstructs an outdoor building as a planar graph from a single RGB image. Conv-MPN is specifically designed for cases where nodes of a graph have explicit spatial embedding. In our problem, nodes correspond to building edges in an image. Conv-MPN is different from MPN in that 1) the feature associated with a node is represented as a feature volume instead of a 1D vector; and 2) convolutions encode messages instead of fully connected layers. Conv-MPN learns to select a true subset of nodes (i.e., building edges) to reconstruct a building planar graph. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations over 2,000 buildings show that Conv-MPN makes significant improvements over the existing fully neural solutions. We believe that the paper has a potential to open a new line of graph neural network research for structured geometry reconstruction.

Differently from the familiar single-instance segmentation problem, co-segmentation is intrinsically contextual: how a shape is segmented can vary depending on the set it is in. Hence, our network features an adaptive learning module to produce a consistent shape segmentation which adapts to a set.

The input to our network is a 3D shape segmented into parts, where each part is first encoded into a feature representation using a part autoencoder. The core component of PQ-NET is a sequence-to-sequence or Seq2Seq autoencoder which encodes a sequence of part features into a latent vector of fixed size, and the decoder reconstructs the 3D shape, one part at a time, resulting in a sequential assembly. The latent space formed by the Seq2Seq encoder encodes both part structure and fine part geometry. The decoder can be adapted to perform several generative tasks including shape autoencoding, interpolation, novel shape generation, and single-view 3D reconstruction, where the generated shapes are all composed of meaningful parts.

   Learning Generative Models of 3D Structures
  image: egstar_2020.png
  description: >-
    3D models of objects and scenes are critical to many academic disciplines and industrial applications. Of particular interest is the emerging opportunity for 3D graphics to serve artificial intelligence: computer vision systems can benefit from synthetically- generated training data rendered from virtual 3D scenes, and robots can be trained to navigate in and interact with real-world environments by first acquiring skills in simulated ones. One of the most promising ways to achieve this is by learning and applying generative models of 3D content: computer programs that can synthesize new 3D shapes and scenes. To allow users to edit and manipulate the synthesized 3D content to achieve their goals, the generative model should also be structure-aware: it should express 3D shapes and scenes using abstractions that allow manipulation of their high-level structure. This state-of-the- art report surveys historical work and recent progress on learning structure-aware generative models of 3D shapes and scenes.

   PlanIT: Planning and Instantiating Indoor Scenes with Relation Graph and Spatial Prior Networks
  image: Kai_planit.png
  description: >-
    We present a new framework for interior scene synthesis that combines a high-level relation graph representation with spatial prior neural networks. We observe that prior work on scene synthesis is divided into two camps: object-oriented approaches (which reason about the set of objects in a scene and their configurations) and space-oriented approaches (which reason about what objects occupy what regions of space). Our insight is that the object-oriented paradigm excels at high-level planning of how a room should be laid out, while the space-oriented paradigm performs well at instantiating a layout by placing objects in precise spatial configurations. With this in mind, we present PlanIT, a layout-generation framework that divides the  problem into two distinct planning and instantiation phases. PlanIT repre- sents the “plan” for a scene via a relation graph, encoding objects as nodes  and spatial/semantic relationships between objects as edges. In the planning phase, it uses a deep graph convolutional generative model to synthesize relation graphs. In the instantiation phase, it uses image-based convolutional network modules to guide a search procedure that places objects into the scene in a manner consistent with the graph. By decomposing the problem in this way, PlanIT generates scenes of comparable quality to those generated by prior approaches (as judged by both people and learned classifiers), while also providing the modeling flexibility of the intermediate relationship graph representation. These graphs allow the system to support applications such as scene synthesis from a partial graph provided by a user.

   The Replica Dataset: A Digital Replica of Indoor Spaces
  image: julian_replica.png
  description: >-
    We introduce Replica, a dataset of 18 highly photo-realistic 3D indoor scene reconstructions at room and building scale. Each scene consists of a dense mesh, highresolution high-dynamic-range (HDR) textures, per-primitive semantic class and instance information, and planar mirror and glass reflectors. The goal of Replica is to enable machine learning (ML) research that relies on visually, geometrically, and semantically realistic generative models of the world – for instance, egocentric computer vision, semantic segmentation in 2D and 3D, geometric inference, and the development of embodied agents (virtual robots) performing navigation, instruction following, and question answering. Due to the high level of realism of the renderings from Replica, there is hope that ML systems trained on Replica may transfer directly to real world image and video data. Together with the data, we are releasing a minimal C++ SDK as a starting point for working with the Replica dataset. In addition, Replica is ‘Habitatcompatible’, i.e. can be natively used with AI Habitat [24] for training and testing embodied agents.

   Habitat: A Platform for Embodied AI Research
  image: manolis_habitat.png
  description: >-
    We present Habitat, a platform for research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI). Habitat enables training embodied agents (virtual robots) in highly efficient photorealistic 3D simulation. Specifically, Habitat consists of: (i) Habitat-Sim: a flexible, high-performance 3D simulator with configurable agents, sensors, and generic 3D dataset handling. Habitat-Sim is fast – when rendering a scene from Matterport3D, it achieves several thousand frames per second (fps) running single-threaded, and can reach over 10,000 fps multi-process on a single GPU. (ii) Habitat-API: a modular high-level library for end-toend development of embodied AI algorithms – defining tasks (e.g. navigation, instruction following, question answering), configuring, training, and benchmarking embodied agents. These large-scale engineering contributions enable us to answer scientific questions requiring experiments that were till now impracticable or ‘merely’ impractical. Specifically, in the context of point-goal navigation: (1) we revisit the comparison between learning and SLAM approaches from two recent works [20, 16] and find evidence for the opposite conclusion – that learning outperforms SLAM if scaled to an order of magnitude more experience than previous investigations, and (2) we conduct the first cross-dataset generalization experiments {train, test} × {Matterport3D, Gibson} for multiple sensors {blind, RGB, RGBD, D} and find that only agents with depth (D) sensors generalize across datasets. We hope that our open-source platform and these findings will advance research in embodied AI.

   Hierarchy Denoising Recursive Autoencoders for 3D Scene Layout Prediction
  image: yifei_hierarchylayout.png
  description: >-
    Indoor scenes exhibit rich hierarchical structure in 3D object layouts. Many tasks in 3D scene understanding can benefit from reasoning jointly about the hierarchical context of a scene, and the identities of objects. We present a variational denoising recursive autoencoder (VDRAE) that generates and iteratively refines a hierarchical representation of 3D object layouts, interleaving bottom-up encoding for context aggregation and top-down decoding for propagation. We train our VDRAE on large-scale 3D scene datasets to predict both instance-level segmentations and a 3D object detections from an over-segmentation of an input point cloud. We show that our VDRAE improves object detection performance on real-world 3D point cloud datasets compared to baselines from prior work.

   PartNet: A Large-scale Benchmark for Fine-grained and Hierarchical Part-level 3D Object Understanding
  image: kaichun_partnet.png
  description: >-
    We present PartNet: a consistent, large-scale dataset of 3D objects annotated with fine-grained, instance-level, and hierarchical 3D part information. Our dataset consists of 573,585 part instances over 26,671 3D models covering 24 object categories. This dataset enables and serves as a catalyst for many tasks such as shape analysis, dynamic 3D scene modeling and simulation, affordance analysis, and others. Using our dataset, we establish three benchmarking tasks for evaluating 3D part recognition: fine-grained semantic segmentation, hierarchical semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. We benchmark four state-ofthe-art 3D deep learning algorithms for fine-grained semantic segmentation and three baseline methods for hierarchical semantic segmentation. We also propose a novel method for part instance segmentation and demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods.

   Scan2CAD: Learning CAD Model Alignment in RGB-D Scans
  image: armen_scan2cad.png
  description: >-
    We present Scan2CAD1 , a novel data-driven method that learns to align clean 3D CAD models from a shape database to the noisy and incomplete geometry of an RGBD scan. For a 3D reconstruction of an indoor scene, our method takes as input a set of CAD models, and predicts a 9DoF pose that aligns each model to the underlying scan geometry. To tackle this problem, we create a new scanto-CAD alignment dataset based on 1506 ScanNet scans with 97607 annotated keypoint pairs between 14225 CAD models from ShapeNet and their counterpart objects in the scans. Our method selects a set of representative keypoints in a 3D scan for which we find correspondences to the CAD geometry. To this end, we design a novel 3D CNN architecture to learn a joint embedding between real and synthetic objects, and thus predict a correspondence heatmaps. Based on these correspondence heatmaps, we formulate a variational energy minimization that aligns a given set of CAD models to the reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on our newly introduced Scan2CAD benchmark where we outperform both handcrafted feature descriptor as well as state-of-the-art CNN based methods by 21.39%.

   Mimic and Rephrase: Reflective Listening in Open-Ended Dialogue
  image: justin_mimic_and_rephrase.png
  description: >-
    Reflective listening—demonstrating that you have heard your conversational partner—is key to effective communication. Expert human communicators often mimic and rephrase their conversational partner, e.g., when responding to sentimental stories or to questions they don’t know the answer to. We introduce a new task and an associated dataset wherein dialogue agents similarly mimic and rephrase a user’s request to communicate sympathy (I’m sorry to hear that) or lack of knowledge (I do not know that). We study what makes a rephrasal response good against a set of qualitative metrics. We then evaluate three models for generating responses: a syntax-aware rulebased system, a seq2seq LSTM neural models with attention (S2SA), and the same neural model augmented with a copy mechanism (S2SA+C). In a human evaluation, we find that S2SA+C and the rule-based system are comparable and approach human-generated response quality. In addition, experiences with a live deployment of S2SA+C in a customer support setting suggest that this generation task is a practical contribution to real world conversational agents.

   LOGAN: Unpaired Shape Transform in Latent Overcomplete Space
  image: yin_LOGAN.png
  description: >-
    We introduce LOGAN, a deep neural network aimed at learning general-purpose shape transforms from unpaired domains. The network is trained on two sets of shapes, e.g., tables and chairs, while there is neither a pairing between shapes from the domains as supervision nor any point-wise correspondence between any shapes. Once trained, LOGAN takes a shape from one domain and transforms it into the other. Our network consists of an autoencoder to encode shapes from the two input domains into a common latent space, where the latent codes concatenate multi-scale shape features, resulting in an overcomplete representation. The translator is based on a latent generative adversarial network (GAN), where an adversarial loss enforces cross-domain translation while a feature preservation loss ensures that the right shape features are preserved for a natural shape transform.

   SDM-NET: Deep Generative Network for Structured Deformable Mesh
  image: gao_SDM.png
  description: >-
    We introduce SDM-NET, a deep generative neural network which produces structured deformable meshes. Specifically, the network is trained to generate a spatial arrangement of closed, deformable mesh parts, which respect the global part structure of a shape collection, e.g., chairs, airplanes, etc. Our key observation is that while the overall structure of a 3D shape can be complex, the shape can usually be decomposed into a set of parts, each homeomorphic to a box, and the finer-scale geometry of the part can be recovered by deforming the box. The architecture of SDM-NET is that of a two-level variational autoencoder (VAE). At the part level, a PartVAE learns a deformable model of part geometries. At the structural level, we train a Structured Parts VAE (SP-VAE), which jointly learns the part structure of a shape collection and the part geometries, ensuring a coherence between global shape structure and surface details.

   Computational LEGO Technic Design
  image: xu_LEGO_long.png
  description: >-
    We introduce a method to automatically compute LEGO Technic models from user input sketches, optionally with motion annotations. The generated models resemble the input sketches with coherently-connected bricks and simple layouts, while respecting the intended symmetry and mechanical properties expressed in the inputs. This complex computational assembly problem involves an immense search space, and a much richer brick set and connection mechanisms than regular LEGO. To address it, we first comprehensively model the brick properties and connection mechanisms, then formulate the construction requirements into an objective function, accounting for faithfulness to input sketch, model simplicity, and structural integrity. Next, we model the problem as a sketch cover, where we iteratively refine a random initial layout to cover the input sketch, while guided by the objective. At last, we provide a working system to analyze the balance, stress, and assemblability of the generated model.

   RPM-Net: Recurrent Prediction of Motion and Parts from Point Cloud
  image: yan_RPM.png
  description: >-
    We introduce RPM-Net, a deep learning-based approach which simultaneously infers movable parts and hallucinates their motions from a single, un-segmented, and possibly partial, 3D point cloud shape. RPM-Net is a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), composed of an encoder-decoder pair with interleaved Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) components, which together predict a temporal sequence of point-wise displacements for the input shape. At the same time, the displacements allow the network to learn moveable parts, resulting in a motion-based shape segmentation. Recursive applications of RPM-Net on the obtained parts can predict finer-level part motions, resulting in a hierarchical object segmentation. Furthermore, we develop a separate network to estimate part mobilities, e.g., per part motion parameters, from the segmented motion sequence.

   BAE-NET: Branched Autoencoder for Shape Co-Segmentation
  image: chen_BAENET.png
  description: >-
    We treat shape co-segmentation as a representation learning problem and introduce BAE-NET, a branched autoencoder network, for the task. The unsupervised BAE-NET is trained with all shapes in an input collection using a shape reconstruction loss, without ground-truth segmentations. Specifically, the network takes an input shape and encodes it using a convolutional neural network, whereas the decoder concatenates the resulting feature code with a point coordinate and outputs a value indicating whether the point is inside/outside the shape. Importantly, the decoder is branched: each branch learns a compact representation for one commonly recurring part of the shape collection, e.g., airplane wings. By complementing the shape reconstruction loss with a label loss, BAE-NET is easily tuned for one-shot learning.

   Learning to Generate the "Unseen" via Part Synthesis and Composition

  description: >-
    Data-driven generative modeling has made remarkable progress by leveraging the power of deep neural networks. A reoccurring challenge is how to sample a rich variety of data from the entire target distribution, rather than only from the distribution of the training data. In other words, we would like the generative model to go beyond the observed training samples and learn to also generate "unseen" data. In our work, we present a generative neural network for shapes that is based on a part-based prior, where the key idea is for the network to synthesize shapes by varying both the shape parts and their compositions.

    We introduce CoSegNet, a deep neural network architecture for co-segmentation of a set of 3D shapes represented as point clouds. CoSegNet takes as input a set of unsegmented shapes, proposes per-shape parts, and then jointly optimizes the part labelings across the set subjected to a novel group consistency loss expressed via matrix rank estimates. The proposals are refined in each iteration by an auxiliary network that acts as a weak regularizing prior, pre-trained to denoise noisy, unlabeled parts from a large collection of segmented 3D shapes, where the part compositions within the same object category can be highly inconsistent. The output is a consistent part labeling for the input set, with each shape segmented into up to K (a user-specified hyperparameter) parts.

Our implicit field decoder is trained to perform this assignment by means of a binary classifier. Specifically, it takes a point coordinate, along with a feature vector encoding a shape, and outputs a value which indicates whether the point is outside the shape or not ...

Using a dataset of annotated scene hierarchies, we train a variational recursive autoencoder, or RvNN-VAE, which performs scene object grouping during its encoding phase and scene generation during decoding.

Moreover, unlike most previous works which apply a pre-determined partition to an input image, our image mosaics are composed by adaptive tiles, whose sizes are determined based on the available images and an objective of maximizing resemblance to the target.

    We introduce BranchGAN, a novel training method that enables unconditioned generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn image manifolds at multiple scales. The key novel feature of BranchGAN is that it is trained in multiple branches, progressively covering both the breadth and depth of the network, as resolutions of the training images increase to reveal finer-scale features. Specifically, each noise vector, as input to the generator network, is explicitly split into several sub-vectors, each corresponding to, and is trained to learn, image representations at a particular scale. During training, we progressively "de-freeze" the sub-vectors, one at a time, as a new set of higher-resolution images is employed for training and more network layers are added.

It outputs an optimized part structure for the composed shape, leading to high-quality geometry construction. A unique feature of our composition network is that it is not merely learning how to connect parts. Our goal is to produce a coherent and plausible 3D shape, despite large incompatibilities among the input parts. The network may significantly alter the geometry and structure of the input parts and synthesize a novel shape structure based on the inputs, while adding or removing parts to minimize a structure plausibility loss.

    We study a new and elegant instance of geometric dissection of 2D shapes: reversible hinged dissection, which corresponds to a dual transform between two shapes where one of them can be dissected in its interior and then inverted inside-out, with hinges on the shape boundary, to reproduce the other shape, and vice versa. We call such a transform reversible inside-out transform or RIOT. Since it is rare for two shapes to possess even a rough RIOT, let alone an exact one, we develop both a RIOT construction algorithm and a quick filtering mechanism to pick, from a shape collection, potential shape pairs that are likely to possess the transform. Our construction algorithm is fully automatic. It computes an approximate RIOT between two given input 2D shapes, whose boundaries can undergo slight deformations, while the filtering scheme picks good inputs for the construction.

   Language-Driven Synthesis of 3D Scenes Using Scene Databases
  image: ma_siga18_t2s.png
  description: >-
    We introduce a novel framework for using natural language to generate and edit 3D indoor scenes, harnessing scene semantics and text-scene grounding knowledge learned from large annotated 3D scene databases. The advantage of natural language editing interfaces is strongest when performing semantic operations at the sub-scene level, acting on groups of objects. We learn how to manipulate these sub-scenes by analyzing existing 3D scenes. We perform edits by first parsing a natural language command from the user and trans- forming it into a semantic scene graph that is used to retrieve corresponding sub-scenes from the databases that match the command. We then augment this retrieved sub-scene by incorporating other objects that may be implied by the scene context. Finally, a new 3D scene is synthesized by aligning the augmented sub-scene with the user's current scene, where new objects are spliced into the environment, possibly triggering appropriate adjustments to the existing scene arrangement.

   SketchyScene: 3D Fabrication with Universal Building Blocks and Pyramidal Shells
  image: chen_siga18_pym.png
  description: >-
    We introduce a computational solution for cost-efficient 3D fabrication using universal building blocks. Our key idea is to employ a set of universal blocks, which can be massively prefabricated at a low cost, to quickly assemble and constitute a significant internal core of the target object, so that only the residual volume need to be 3D printed online. We further improve the fabrication efficiency by decomposing the residual volume into a small number of printing-friendly pyramidal pieces.

   SketchyScene: Richly-Annotated Scene Sketches
  image: zou_eccv18_sketch.png
  description: >-
    We contribute the first large-scale dataset of scene sketches, SketchyScene, with the goal of advancing research on sketch understanding at both the object and scene level. The dataset is created through a novel and carefully designed crowdsourcing pipeline, enabling users to efficiently generate large quantities realistic and diverse scene sketches. SketchyScene contains more than 29,000 scene-level sketches, 7,000+ pairs of scene templates and photos, and 11,000+ object sketches. All objects in the scene sketches have ground-truth semantic and instance masks. The dataset is also highly scalable and extensible, easily allowing augmenting and/or changing scene composition. We demonstrate the potential impact of SketchyScene by training new computational models for semantic segmentation of scene sketches and showing how the new dataset enables several applications including image retrieval, sketch colorization, editing, and captioning, etc. We will release the complete crowdsourced dataset to the community.

   P2P-NET: Bidirectional Point Displacement Net for Shape Transform
  image: yin_sig18_p2p.png
  description: >-
    We introduce P2P-NET, a general-purpose deep neural network which learns geometric transformations between point-based shape representations from two domains, e.g., meso-skeletons and surfaces, partial and complete scans, etc. The architecture of the P2P-NET is that of a bi-directional point dis- placement network, which transforms a source point set to a prediction of the target point set with the same cardinality, and vice versa, by applying point-wise displacement vectors learned from data. P2P-NET is trained on paired shapes from the source and target domains, but without relying on point-to-point correspondences between the source and target point sets. The training loss combines two uni-directional geometric losses, each enforc- ing a shape-wise similarity between the predicted and the target point sets, and a cross-regularization term to encourage consistency between displace- ment vectors going in opposite directions.

   Predictive and Generative Neural Networks for Object Functionality
  image: hu_sig18_icon4.png
  description: >-
    Humans can predict the functionality of an object even without any surroundings, since their knowledge and experience would allow them to "hallucinate" the interaction or usage scenarios involving the object. We develop predictive and generative deep convolutional neural networks to replicate this feat. Our networks are trained on a database of scene contexts, called interaction contexts, each consisting of a central object and one or more surrounding objects, that represent object functionalities. Given a 3D object in isolation, our functional similarity network (fSIM-NET), a variation of the triplet network, is trained to predict the functionality of the object by inferring functionality-revealing interaction contexts involving the object. fSIM-NET is complemented by a generative network (iGEN-NET) and a segmentation network (iSEG-NET). iGEN-NET takes a single voxelized 3D object and synthesizes a voxelized surround, i.e., the interaction context which visually demonstrates the object's functionalities. iSEG-NET separates the interacting objects into different groups according to their interaction types.

   DSCarver: Decompose-and-Spiral-Carve for Subtractive Manufacturing
  image: zhao_sig18_cnc.png
  description: >-
    We present an automatic algorithm for subtractive manufacturing of freeform 3D objects using high-speed CNC machining. Our method decomposes the input object's surface into a small number of patches each of which is fully accessible and machinable by the CNC machine, in continuous fashion, under a fixed drill-object setup configuration. This is achieved by covering the input surface using a minimum number of accessible regions and then extracting a set of machinable patches from each accessible region. For each patch obtained, we compute a continuous, space-filling, and iso-scallop tool path, in the form of connected Fermat spirals, which conforms to the patch boundary. Furthermore, we develop a novel method to control the spacing of Fermat spirals based on directional surface curvature and adapt the heat method to obtain iso-scallop carving.

   A Sampling Approach to Generating Closely Interacting 3D Pose-pairs from 2D Annotations
  image: yin_tvcg18_intpair_small.png
  description: >-
    We introduce a data-driven method to generate a large number of plausible, closely interacting 3D human pose-pairs, for a given motion category, e.g., wrestling or salsa dance. With much difficulty in acquiring close interactions using 3D sensors, our approach utilizes abundant existing video data which cover many human activities. Instead of treating the data generation problem as one of reconstruction, we present a solution based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Given a motion category and a set of video frames depicting the motion with the 2D pose-pair in each frame annotated, we start the sampling with one or few seed 3D pose-pairs which are manually created based on the target motion category. The initial set is then augmented by MCMC sampling around the seeds, via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and guided by a probability density function (PDF) that is defined by two terms to bias the sampling towards 3D pose-pairs that are physically valid and plausible for the motion category.

   Class-Sensitive Shape Dissimilarity Metric
  image: li_gm18_csmetric.png
  description: >-
    Shape dissimilarity is a fundamental problem with many applications such as shape exploration, retrieval, and classification. Given a collection of shapes, all existing methods develop a consistent global metric to compareand organize shapes. The global nature of the involved shape descriptors implies that overall shape appearanceis compared. These methods work well to distinguishshapes from different categories, but often fail for fine-grained classes within the same category. In this paper, we develop a dissimilarity metric for fine-grained classes by fusing together multiple distinctive metrics for different classes. The fused metric measures the dissimilarities among inter-class shapes by observing their unique traits.

   Branched Generative Adversarial Networks for Multi-Scale Image Manifold Learning

  description: >-
    Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for cross-domain image-to-image translation have made much progress recently. Depending on the task complexity, thousands to millions of labeled image pairs are needed to train a conditional GAN. However, human labeling is expensive, even impractical, and large quantities of data may not always be available. Inspired by dual learning from natural language translation, we develop a novel dual-GAN mechanism, which enables image translators to be trained from two sets of unlabeled images from two domains. In our architecture, the primal GAN learns to translate images from domain U to those in domain V, while the dual GAN learns to invert the task. The closed loop made by the primal and dual tasks allows images from either domain to be translated and then reconstructed. Hence a loss function that accounts for the reconstruction error of images can be used to train the translators.

Another property of the style-defining elements is that they are frequently-occurring, reflecting shape characteristics that appear across multiple shapes of the same style.

In this paper, we propose a technique for online video stabilization with only one frame latency using a novel MeshFlow motion model. The MeshFlow is a spatial smooth sparse motion field with motion vectors only at the mesh vertexes.

- title: Attribute Recognition from Adaptive Parts
  image: luwei_16_bmvc.PNG
  description: Previous part-based attribute recognition approaches perform part detection and attribute recognition in separate steps. The parts are not optimized for attribute recognitionand therefore could be sub-optimal. We present an end-to-end deep learning approach to overcome the limitation.

- title: Automatic Fence Segmentation in Videos of Dynamic Scenes
  image: joyce_16_cvpr.PNG
  description: We present a fully automatic approach to detect and segment fence-like occluders from a video clip. Unlike previous approaches that usually assume either static scenes or cameras, our method is capable of handling both dynamic scenes and moving cameras. Under a bottom-up framework, it first clusters pixels into coherent groups using color and motion features. These pixel groups are then analyzed in a fully connected graph, and labeled as either fence or non-fence using graph-cut optimization. Finally, we solve a dense Conditional Random Filed (CRF) constructed from multiple frames to enhance both spatial accuracy and temporal coherence of the segmentation

- title: Deformation-Driven Topology-Varying 3D Shape Correspondence
  image: dd3dcorrespondence.png
  description: We present a deformation-driven approach to topology-varying 3D shape correspondence. In this paradigm, the best correspondence between two shapes is the one that results in a minimal-energy, possibly topology-varying, deformation that transforms one shape to conform to the other while respecting the correspondence. Our deformation model, called GeoTopo transform, allows both geometric and topological operations such as part split, duplication, and merging, leading to fine-grained and piecewise continuous correspondence results. The key ingredient of our correspondence scheme is a deformation energy that penalizes geometric distortion, encourages structure preservation, and simultaneously allows topology changes. This is accomplished by connecting shape parts using structural rods, which behave similarly to virtual springs but simultaneously allow the encoding of energies arising from geometric, structural, and topological shape variations. Driven by the combined deformation energy, an optimal shape correspondence is obtained via a pruned beam search. We demonstrate our deformation-driven correspondence scheme on extensive sets of man-made models with rich geometric and topological variation and compare the results to state-of-the-art approaches.

- title: Garment Modeling with a Depth Camera
  image: garment.png
  description: We study the modeling of real garments and develop a system that is intuitive to use even for novice users. Our system includes garment component detectors and design attribute classifiers learned from a manually labeled garment image database. In the modeling time, we scan the garment with a Kinect and build a rough shape by KinectFusion from the raw RGBD sequence. The detectors and classifiers will identify garment components (e.g. collar, sleeve, pockets, belt, and buttons) and their design attributes (e.g. falbala collar or lapel collar, hubble-bubble sleeve or straight sleeve) from the RGB images. Our system also contains a 3D deformable template database for garment components. Once the components and their designs are determined, we choose appropriate templates, stitch them together, and fit them to the initial garment mesh generated by KinectFusion. Experiments on various different garment styles consistently generate high quality results.

- title: Dapper&#58; Decompose-and-Pack for 3D Printing
  image: dapper.png
  description: We pose the decompose-and-pack or DAP problem, which tightly combines shape decomposition and packing. While in general, DAP seeks to decompose an input shape into a small number of parts which can be efficiently packed, our focus is geared towards 3D printing. The goal is to optimally decompose-and-pack a 3D object into a printing volume to minimize support material, build time, and assembly cost. We present Dapper, a global optimization algorithm for the DAP problem which can be applied to both powder and FDM-based 3D printing. The solution search is top-down and iterative. Starting with a coarse decomposition of the input shape into few initial parts, we progressively pack a pile in the printing volume, by iteratively docking parts, possibly while introducing cuts, onto the pile. Exploration of the search space is via a prioritized and bounded beam search, with breadth and depth pruning guided by local and global DAP objectives.

- title: Generalized Cylinder Decomposition
  image: cylinder.png
  description: Decomposing a complex shape into geometrically simple primitives is a fundamental problem in geometry processing. We are interested in a shape decomposition problem where the simple primitives sought are generalized cylinders, which are ubiquitous in both organic forms and man-made artifacts. We introduce a quantitative measure of cylindricity for a shape part and develop a cylindricity-driven optimization algorithm, with a global objective function, for generalized cylinder decomposition. As a measure of geometric simplicity and following the minimum description length principle, cylindricity is defined as the cost of representing a cylinder through skeletal and cross-section profile curves. Our decomposition algorithm progressively builds local to non-local cylinders, which form over-complete covers of the input shape. The over-completeness of the cylinder covers ensures a conservative buildup of the cylindrical parts, leaving the final decision on decomposition to global optimization. We solve the global optimization by finding an exact cover, which optimizes the global objective function.

Namely, given a 3D object representing a piece of furniture, our goal is to apply a minimum amount of modification to the object so that it can be folded to save space --- the object is thus foldabilized. We focus on one instance of the problem where folding is with respect to a prescribed folding direction and allowed object modifications include hinge insertion and part shrinking.

- title: "Interaction Context (ICON)&#58; Towards a Geometric Functionality Descriptor"
  image: icon.png
  description: We introduce a contextual descriptor which aims to provide a geometric description of the functionality of a 3D object in the context of a given scene. Differently from previous works, we do not regard functionality as an abstract label or represent it implicitly through an agent. Our descriptor, called interaction context or ICON for short, explicitly represents the geometry of object-to-object interactions. Our approach to object functionality analysis is based on the key premise that functionality should mainly be derived from interactions between objects and not objects in isolation. Specifically, ICON collects geometric and structural features to encode interactions between a central object in a 3D scene and its surrounding objects. These interactions are then grouped based on feature similarity, leading to a hierarchical structure.

  description: In our formulation, the depth cues from stereo matching and fog information reinforce each other, and produce superior results than conventional stereo or defogging algorithms. We first improve the photo-consistency term to explicitly model the appearance change due to the scattering effects. The prior matting Laplacian constraint on fog transmission imposes a detail preserving smoothness constraint on the scene depth. We further enforce the ordering consistency between scene depth and fog transmission at neighboring points.

Our approach is unsupervised, built on a novel clustering scheme, and solves the distillation and object segmentation problems simultaneously.

  description: Enhancing the self-symmetry of a shape is of fundamental aesthetic virtue. In this paper, we are interested in recov- ering the aesthetics of intrinsic reflection symmetries, where an asymmetric shape is symmetrized while keeping its general pose and perceived dynamics. The key challenge to intrinsic symmetrization is that the input shape has only approximate reflection symmetries, possibly far from perfect. The main premise of our work is that curve skeletons provide a concise and effective shape abstraction for analyzing approximate intrinsic symmetries as well as symmetrization.

  description: We introduce indirect shape analysis, or ISA, where a given shape is analyzed not based on geometric or topological features computed directly from the shape itself, but by studying how external agents interact with the shape. The potential benefits of ISA are two-fold. First, agent-object interactions often reveal an objectâ€™s function, which plays a key role in shape understanding. Second, compared to direct shape analysis, ISA, which utilizes pre-selected agents, is less affected by imperfections of, or inconsistencies between, the geometry or topology of the analyzed shapes.

- title: Linear Global Translation Estimation with Feature Tracks

  description: This paper derives a novel linear position constraint for cameras seeing a common scene point, which leads to a direct linear method for global camera translation estimation. Unlike previous solutions, this method deals with collinear camera motion and weak image association at the same time. The final linear formulation does not involve the coordinates of scene points, which makes it efficient even for large scale data. We solve the linear equation based on $L_1$ norm, which makes our system more robust to outliers in essential matrices and feature correspondences. We experiment this method on both sequentially captured images and unordered Internet images. The experiments demonstrate its strength in robustness, accuracy, and efficiency.

- title: Global Structure-from-Motion by Similarity Averaging
  image: globalmotion.png
  description: Global structure-from-motion (SfM) methods solve all cameras simultaneously from all available relative motions. It has better potential in both reconstruction accuracy and computation efficiency than incremental methods. However, global SfM is challenging, mainly because of two reasons. Firstly, translation averaging is difficult, since an essential matrix only tells the direction of relative translation. Secondly, it is also hard to filter out bad essential matrices due to feature matching failures. We propose to compute a sparse depth image at each camera to solve both problems. Depth images help to upgrade an essential matrix to a similarity transformation, which can determine the scale of relative translation. Thus, camera registration is formulated as a well-posed similarity averaging problem. Depth images also make the filtering of essential matrices simple and effective. In this way, translation averaging can be solved robustly in two convex L1 optimization problems, which reach the global optimum rapidly. We demonstrate this method in various examples including sequential data, Internet data, and ambiguous data with repetitive scene structures.

- title: Co-Hierarchical Analysis of Shape Structures
  image: cohierarchical.png
  description: We introduce an unsupervised co-hierarchical analysis of a set of shapes, aimed at discovering their hierarchical part structures and revealing relations between geometrically dissimilar yet functionally equivalent shape parts across the set. The core problem is that of representative co-selection. For each shape in the set, one representative hierarchy (tree) is selected from among many possible interpretations of the hierarchical structure of the shape. Collectively, the selected tree representatives maximize the within-cluster structural similarity among them. We develop an iterative algorithm for representative co-selection. At each step, a novel cluster-and-select scheme is applied to a set of candidate trees for all the shapes. The tree-to-tree distance for clustering caters to structural shape analysis by focusing on spatial arrangement of shape parts, rather than their geometric details. The final set of representative trees are unified to form a structural co-hierarchy. We demonstrate co-hierarchical analysis on families of man-made shapes exhibiting high degrees of geometric and finer-scale structural variabilities.

  description: We introduce L1-medial skeleton as a curve skeleton representation for 3D point cloud data. The L1-median is well-known as a robust global center of an arbitrary set of points. We make the key observation that adapting L1-medians locally to a point set representing a 3D shape gives rise to a one-dimensional structure, which can be seen as a localized center of the shape.

- title: Qualitative Organization of Collections of Shapes via Quartet Analysis
  image: quartet.png
  description: We present a method for organizing a heterogeneous collection of 3D shapes for overview and exploration. Instead of relying on quantitative distances, which may become unreliable between dissimilar shapes, we introduce a qualitative analysis which utilizes multiple distance measures but only in cases where the measures can be reliably compared. Our analysis is based on the notion of quartets , each defined by two pairs of shapes, where the shapes in each pair are close to each other, but far apart from the shapes in the other pair. Combining the information from many quartets computed across a shape collection using several distance measures, we create a hierarchical structure we call categorization tree of the shape collection. This tree satisfies the topological (qualitative) constraints imposed by the quartets creating an effective organi- zation of the shapes.

- title: Bilateral Maps for Partial Matching
  image: bilateral.png
  description: We introduce the bilateral map, a local shape descriptor whose region of interest is defined by two feature points. Compared to the classical descriptor definition using a single point, the bilateral approach exploits the use of a second point to place more constraints on the selection of the spatial context for feature analysis. This leads to a descriptor where the shape of the region of interest adapts to the context of the two points, making it more refined for shape matching. In particular, we show that our new descriptor is more effective for partial matching, since potentially extraneous regions of the models are selectively ignored owing to the adaptive nature of the bilateral map.

- title: New Evaluation Metrics for Mesh Segmentation

  description: We propose two novel metrics to support comparison with multiple ground-truth segmentations, which are named Similarity Hamming Distance (SHD) and Adaptive Entropy Increment (AEI). SHD is based on partial similarity correspondences between automatic segmentation and ground-truth segmentations, and AEI measures entropy change when an automatic segmentation is added to a set of different ground-truth segmentations. A group of experiments demonstrates that the metrics are able to provide relatively higher discriminative power and stability when evaluating different hierarchical segmentations, and also provide an effective evaluation more consistent with human perception.

Further, we attempt to list the key open problems and challenges, both at the technical and at the conceptual level, to make it easier for new researchers to better explore and contribute to this topic. Our goal is to both give the practitioner an overview of available structure-aware shape processing techniques, as well as identify future research questions in this important, emerging, and fascinating research area.

- title: Curve Style Analysis in a Set of Shapes
  image: curvestyleanalysis.png
  description: The word “style” can be interpreted in so many different ways in so many different contexts. To provide a general analysis and understanding of styles is a highly challenging problem. We pose the open question “how to extract styles from geometric shapes?” and address one instance of the problem. Specifically, we present an unsupervised algorithm for identifying curve styles in a set of shapes. In our setting, a curve style is explicitly represented by a mode of curve features appearing along the 2D silhouettes of the shapes in the set. Unlike previous attempts, we do not rely on any preconceived conceptual characterizations, e.g., via specific shape descriptors, to define what is or is not a style. Our definition of styles is data-dependent ; it depends on the input set but we do not require computing a shape correspondence across the set. We provide an operational definition of curve styles which focuses on separating curve features that represent styles from curve features that are content-revealing. To this end, we develop a novel formulation and associated algorithm for style-content separation. The analysis is based on a feature-shape association matrix (FSM) whose rows correspond to modes of curve features, columns to shapes in the set, and each entry expresses the extent a feature mode is present in a shape.

- title: Edge-Aware Point Set Resampling
  image: edgeawareresampling.png
  description: Points acquired by laser scanners are not intrinsically equipped with normals, which are essential to surface reconstruction and point set rendering using surfels. Normal estimation is notoriously sensitive to noise. Near sharp features, the computation of noise-free normals becomes even more challenging due to the inherent undersampling problem at edge singularities. As a result, common edge-aware consolidation techniques such as bilateral smoothing may still produce erroneous normals near the edges. We propose a resampling approach to process a noisy and possibly outlier-ridden point set in an edge-aware manner. Our key idea is to first resample away from the edges so that reliable normals can be computed at the samples, and then based on reliable data, we progressively resample the point set while approaching the edge singularities. We demonstrate that our Edge-Aware Resampling (EAR) algorithm is capable of producing consolidated point sets with noise-free normals and clean preservation of sharp features. We also show that EAR leads to improved performance of edge-aware reconstruction methods and point set rendering techniques.

- title: A Global Linear Method for Camera Pose Registration
  image: globalregistration.png
  description: We present a linear method for global camera pose registration from pair wise relative poses encoded in essential matrices. Our method minimizes an approximate geometric error to enforce the triangular relationship in camera triplets. This formulation does not suffer from the typical `unbalanced scale' problem in linear methods relying on pair wise translation direction constraints, i.e. an algebraic error, nor the system degeneracy from collinear motion. In the case of three cameras, our method provides a good linear approximation of the trifocal tensor. It can be directly scaled up to register multiple cameras. The results obtained are accurate for point triangulation and can serve as a good initialization for final bundle adjustment. We evaluate the algorithm performance with different types of data and demonstrate its effectiveness. Our system produces good accuracy, robustness, and outperforms some well-known systems on efficiency.

  image: tuner.png
  description: In this paper we address the difficult problem of parameter-finding in image segmentation. We replace a tedious manual process that is often based on guess-work and luck by a principled approach that systematically explores the parameter space. Our core idea is the following two-stage technique&#58; We start with a sparse sampling of the parameter space and apply a statistical model to estimate the response of the segmentation algorithm. The statistical model incorporates a model of uncertainty of the estimation which we use in conjunction with the actual estimate in (visually) guiding the user towards areas that need refinement by placing additional sample points. In the second stage the user navigates through the parameter space in order to determine areas where the response value (goodness of segmentation) is high. In our exploration we rely on existing ground-truth images in order to evaluate the "goodness" of an image segmentation technique. We evaluate its usefulness by demonstrating this technique on two image segmentation algorithms&#58; a three parameter model to detect microtubules in electron tomograms and an eight parameter model to identify functional regions in dynamic Positron Emission Tomography scans.

  image: unsupervisedcosegmentation.png
  description: We introduce an algorithm for unsupervised co-segmentation of a set of shapes so as to reveal the semantic shape parts and establish their correspondence across the set. The input set may exhibit significant shape variability where the shapes do not admit proper spatial alignment and the corresponding parts in any pair of shapes may be geometrically dissimilar. Our algorithm can handle such challenging input sets since, first, we perform co-analysis in a descriptor space, where a combination of shape descriptors relates the parts independently of their pose, location, and cardinality. Secondly, we exploit a key enabling feature of the input set, namely, dissimilar parts may be "linked" through third-parties present in the set. The links are derived from the pairwise similarities between the parts' descriptors. To reveal such linkages, which may manifest themselves as anisotropic and non-linear structures in the descriptor space, we perform spectral clustering with the aid of diffusion maps. We show that with our approach, we are able to co-segment sets of shapes that possess significant variability, achieving results that are close to those of a supervised approach.

- title: A Survey on Shape Correspondence
  image: surveycorrespondence.png
  description: We review methods designed to compute correspondences between geometric shapes represented by triangle meshes, contours or point sets. This survey is motivated in part by recent developments in space–time registration, where one seeks a correspondence between non-rigid and time-varying surfaces, and semantic shape analysis, which underlines a recent trend to incorporate shape understanding into the analysis pipeline. Establishing a meaningful correspondence between shapes is often difficult because it generally requires an understanding of the structure of the shapes at both the local and global levels, and sometimes the functionality of the shape parts as well. Despite its inherent complexity, shape correspondence is a recurrent problem and an essential component of numerous geometry processing applications. In this survey, we discuss the different forms of the correspondence problem and review the main solution methods, aided by several classification criteria arising from the problem definition. The main categories of classification are defined in terms of the input and output representation, objective function and solution approach. We conclude the survey by discussing open problems and future perspectives

- title: Photo-Inspired Model-Driven 3D Object Modeling
  image: photoinspiredmodeling.png
  description: We introduce an algorithm for 3D object modeling where the user draws creative inspiration from an object captured in a single photograph. Our method leverages the rich source of photographs for creative 3D modeling. However, with only a photo as a guide, creating a 3D model from scratch is a daunting task. We support the modeling process by utilizing an available set of 3D candidate models. Specifically, the user creates a digital 3D model as a geometric variation from a 3D candidate. Our modeling technique consists of two major steps. The first step is a user-guided image-space object segmentation to reveal the structure of the photographed object. The core step is the second one, in which a 3D candidate is automatically deformed to fit the photographed target under the guidance of silhouette correspondence. The set of candidate models have been pre-analyzed to possess useful high-level structural information, which is heavily utilized in both steps to compensate for the ill-posedness of the analysis and modeling problems based only on content in a single image. Equally important, the structural information is preserved by the geometric variation so that the final product is coherent with its inherited structural information readily usable for subsequent model refinement or processing.

- title: VASE&#58; Volume-Aware Surface Evolution for Surface Reconstruction from Incomplete Point Clouds
  image: vase.png
  description: Objects with many concavities are difficult to acquire using laser scanners. The highly concave areas are hard to access by a scanner due to occlusions by other components of the object. The resulting point scan typically suffers from large amounts of missing data. Methods that use surface-based priors rely on local surface estimates and perform well only when filling small holes. When the holes become large, the reconstruction problem becomes severely under-constrained, which necessitates the use of additional reconstruction priors. In this paper, we introduce weak volumetric priors which assume that the volume of a shape varies smoothly and that each point cloud sample is visible from outside the shape. Specifically, the union of view-rays given by the scanner implicitly carves the exterior volume, while volumetric smoothness regularizes the internal volume. We incorporate these priors into a surface evolution framework where a new energy term defined by volumetric smoothness is introduced to handle large amount of missing data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on objects exhibiting deep concavities, and show its general applicability over a broader spectrum of geometric scenario.

We also develop an application of symmetry hierarchies for structural shape editing.

- title: Prior Knowledge for Part Correspondence
  image: priorknowledge.png
  description: We stipulate that in these cases, shape correspondence by humans involves recognition of the shape parts where prior knowledge on the parts would play a more dominant role than geometric similarity. We introduce an approach to part correspondence which incorporates prior knowledge imparted by a training set of pre-segmented, labeled models and combines the knowledge with content driven analysis based on geometric similarity between the matched shapes. First, the prior knowledge is learned from the training set in the form of per-label classifiers. Next, given two query shapes to be matched, we apply the classifiers to assign a probabilistic label to each shape face. Finally,by means of a joint labeling scheme, the probabilistic labels are used synergistically with pairwise assignments derived from geometric similarity to provide the resulting part correspondence.

  description: We demonstrate that sort first distributions are not only a viable method of performing data scalable parallel volume rendering, but more importan tly they allow for a range of rendering algorithms and techniques that are not efficient with sort last distributions. Several of these algorithms are discussed and two of them are implemented in a parallel environment&#58; a new improved variant of early ray termination to speed up rendering when volumetric occlusion occurs and a volumetric shadowing technique that produces more realistic and infor mative images based on half angle slicing. Improved methods of distributing the computation of the load balancing and loading portions o f a subdivided data set are also presented. Our detailed test r esults for a typical GPU cluster with distributed memory show that our sort first rendering algorithm outperforms sort last rendering in many scenarios.

- title: Visual Comparability of 3D Regular Sampling and Reconstruction
  image: visualcomparability.png
  description: The Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) and Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattices have been analytically shown to be more efficient sampling lattices than the traditional Cartesian Cubic (CC) lattice, but there has been no estimate of their visual comparability. Two perceptual studies (each with N = 12 participants) compared the visual quality of images rendered from BCC and FCC lattices to images rendered from the CC lattice. Images were generated from two signals&#58; the commonly used Marschner-Lobb synthetic function and a computed tomography scan of a fish tail. Observers found that BCC and FCC could produce images of comparable visual quality to CC, using 30-35 percent fewer samples. For the images used in our studies, the L(2) error metric shows high correlation with the judgement of human observers. Using the L(2) metric as a proxy, the results of the experiments appear to extend across a wide range of images and parameter choices.

- title: Toward High-Quality Gradient Estimation on Regular Lattices
  image: highqualitygradient.gif
  description: We present two methods for accurate gradient estimation from scalar field data sampled on regular lattices. The first method is based on the multidimensional Taylor series expansion of the convolution sum and allows us to specify design criteria such as compactness and approximation power. The second method is based on a Hilbert space framework and provides a minimum error solution in the form of an orthogonal projection operating between two approximation spaces. Both methods lead to discrete filters, which can be combined with continuous reconstruction kernels to yield highly accurate estimators as compared to the current state of the art. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods in the context of volume rendering of data sampled on Cartesian and Body-Centered Cubic lattices. Our results show significant qualitative and quantitative improvements for both synthetic and real data, while incurring a moderate preprocessing and storage overhead.

This enables associating each point with a generalized cone, called the visibility cone, that carves a portion of the outside ambient space of the shape from the inside out.

- title: Tangential Distance Field for Mesh Silhouette Analysis
  image: tangental.png
  description: We consider a tangent-space representation of surfaces that maps each point on a surface to the tangent plane of the surface at that point. Such representations are known to facilitate the solution of several visibility problems, in particular, those involving silhouette analysis. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of distance fields for a given surface defined by its tangent planes. At each point in space, we assign a scalar value which is a weighted sum of distances to these tangent planes. We call the resulting scalar field a ‘tangential distance field’ (TDF). When applied to triangle mesh models, the tangent planes become supporting planes of the mesh triangles. The weighting scheme used to construct a TDF for a given mesh and the way the TDF is utilized can be closely tailored to a specific application. At the same time, the TDFs are continuous, lending themselves to standard optimization techniques such as greedy local search, thus leading to efficient algorithms.

- title: Partial Intrinsic Reflectional Symmetry of 3D Shapes
  image: partialintrinsicsym.png
  description: While many 3D objects exhibit various forms of global symmetries, prominent intrinsic symmetries which exist only on parts of an object are also well recognized. Such partial symmetries are often seen as more natural compared to a global one, especially on a composite shape. We introduce algorithms to extract partial intrinsic reflectional symmetries (PIRS) of a 3D shape. Given a closed 2-manifold mesh, we develop a voting scheme to obtain an intrinsic reflectional symmetry axis (IRSA) transform, which computes a scalar field over the mesh so as to accentuate prominent IRSAs of the shape. We then extract a set of explicit IRSA curves on the shape based on a refined measure of local reflectional symmetry support along a curve. The iterative refinement procedure combines IRSA-induced region growing and region-constrained symmetry support refinement to improve accuracy and address potential issues due to rotational symmetries in the shape. We show how the extracted IRSA curves can be incorporated into a conventional mesh segmentation scheme so that the implied symmetry cues can be utilized to obtain more meaningful results. We also demonstrate the use of IRSA curves for symmetry-driven part repair.

- title: Segmentation-Based Regularization of Dynamic SPECT Reconstruction
  image: segbasedreg.png
  description: Dynamic SPECT reconstruction using a single slow camera rotation is a highly underdetermined problem, which requires the use of regularization techniques to obtain useful results. The dSPECT algorithm (Farncombe et al. 1999) provides temporal but not spatial regularization, resulting in poor contrast and low activity levels in organs of interest, due mostly to blurring. In this paper we incorporate a user-assisted segmentation algorithm (Saad et al. 2008) into the reconstruction process to improve the results. Following an initial reconstruction using the existing dSPECT technique, a user places seeds in the image to indicate regions of interest (ROIs). A random-walk based automatic segmentation algorithm then assigns every voxel in the image to one of the ROIs, based on its proximity to the seeds as well as the similarity between time activity curves (TACs). The user is then able to visualize the segmentation and improve it if necessary. Average TACs are extracted from each ROI and assigned to every voxel in the ROI, giving an image with a spatially uniform TAC in each ROI. This image is then used as initial input to a second run of dSPECT, in order to adjust the dynamic image to better fit the projection data. We test this approach with a digital phantom simulating the kinetics of Tc99m-DTPA in the renal system, including healthy and unhealthy behaviour. Summed TACs for each kidney and the bladder were calculated for the spatially regularized and non-regularized reconstructions, and compared to the true values. The TACs for the two kidneys were noticeably improved in every case, while TACs for the smaller bladder region were unchanged. Furthermore, in two cases where the segmentation was intentionally done incorrectly, the spatially regularized reconstructions were still as good as the non-regularized ones. In general, the segmentation-based regularization improves TAC quality within ROIs, as well as image contrast.

- title: Curve Skeleton Extraction from Incomplete Point Cloud
  image: curveskeleton.png
  description: We present an algorithm for curve skeleton extraction from imperfect point clouds where large portions of the data may be missing. Our construction is primarily based on a novel notion of generalized rotational symmetry axis (ROSA) of an oriented point set. Specifically, given a subset S of oriented points, we introduce a variational definition for an oriented point that is most rotationally symmetric with respect to S. Our formulation effectively utilizes normal information to compensate for the missing data and leads to robust curve skeleton computation over regions of a shape that are generally cylindrical. We present an iterative algorithm via planar cuts to compute the ROSA of a point cloud. This is complemented by special handling of non-cylindrical joint regions to obtain a centered, topologically clean, and complete 1D skeleton. We demonstrate that quality curve skeletons can be extracted from a variety of shapes captured by incomplete point clouds. Finally, we show how our algorithm assists in shape completion under these challenges by developing a skeleton-driven point cloud completion scheme.

Our multi-resolution representation includes a traditional bottom-up approach and a novel top-down hierarchy for adaptive hierarchical reconstruction. Using a hybrid regularization functional we can improve the reconstruction results. Finally, we discuss further application scenarios and show rendering results to emphasize the effectiveness and quality of our proposed framework. By means of qualitative results and error comparisons we demonstrate superiority of our method compared to competing methods.

- title: Hue-Preserving Color Blending
  image: huepreserving.gif
  description: We propose a new perception-guided compositing operator for color blending. The operator maintains the same rules for achromatic compositing as standard operators (such as the over operator), but it modifies the computation of the chromatic channels. Chromatic compositing aims at preserving the hue of the input colors; color continuity is achieved by reducing the saturation of colors that are to change their hue value. The main benefit of hue preservation is that color can be used for proper visual labeling, even under the constraint of transparency rendering or image overlays. Therefore, the visualization of nominal data is improved. Hue-preserving blending can be used in any existing compositing algorithm, and it is particularly useful for volume rendering. The usefulness of hue-preserving blending and its visual characteristics are shown for several examples of volume visualization.

We show, for the first time, the equivalence of the standard implementation of the EM-based reconstruction with an implementation based on hardware-accelerated volume rendering for nearest-neighbor (NN) interpolation. This equivalence suggests that higher-order kernels should be used with caution and do not necessarily lead to better performance. We also show that the EM algorithm can easily be adapted for different lattices, the body-centered cubic (BCC) one in particular. For validation purposes, we use the 3D version of the Shepp-Logan synthetic phantom, for which we derive closed-form analytical expressions of the projection data.

The analysis is done by means of the Delaunay edge flipping algorithm and it reveals the details of the distinction between these two mesh structures. In particular we observe that the obstructions which prohibit the existence of Gabriel meshes as homeomorphic representatives of smooth surfaces do not hinder the construction of Delaunay meshes.

- title: Feature-Aligned Shape Texturing
  image: featurealigned.png
  description: The essence of a 3D shape can often be well captured by its salient feature curves. In this paper, we explore the use of salient curves in synthesizing intuitive, shape-revealing textures on surfaces. Our texture synthesis is guided by two principles&#58; matching the direction of the texture patterns to those of the salient curves, and aligning the prominent feature lines in the texture to the salient curves exactly. We have observed that textures synthesized by these principles not only fit naturally to the surface geometry, but also visually reveal, even reinforce, the shape's essential characteristics. We call these feature-aligned shape texturing. Our technique is fully automatic, and introduces two novel technical components in vector-field-guided texture synthesis&#58; an algorithm that orients the salient curves on a surface for constrained vector field generation, and a feature-to-feature texture optimization.

- title: Consolidation of Unorganized Point Clouds for Surface Reconstruction
  image: consolidation.png
  description: We consolidate an unorganized point cloud with noise, outliers, non-uniformities, and in particular interference between close-by surface sheets as a preprocess to surface generation, focusing on reliable normal estimation. Our algorithm includes two new developments. First, a weighted locally optimal projection operator produces a set of denoised, outlier-free and evenly distributed particles over the original dense point cloud, so as to improve the reliability of local PCA for initial estimate of normals. Next, an iterative framework for robust normal estimation is introduced, where a priority-driven normal propagation scheme based on a new priority measure and an orientation-aware PCA work complementarily and iteratively to consolidate particle normals. The priority setting is reinforced with front stopping at thin surface features and normal flipping to enable robust handling of the close-by surface sheet problem. We demonstrate how a point cloud that is well-consolidated by our method steers conventional surface generation schemes towards a proper interpretation of the input data.

Subsampling using this dilation matrix leads to a similarity-transformed version of the lattice with a chosen density reduction.

- title: A Part-Aware Surface Metric for Shape Analysis
  image: partawaremetric.png
  description: The main contribution of our work is to bring together these two fundamental concepts&#58; shape parts and surface metric. Specifically, we develop a surface metric that is part-aware. To encode part information at a point on a shape, we model its volumetric context – called the volumetric shape image (VSI) – inside the shape's enclosed volume, to capture relevant visibility information. We then define the part-aware metric by combining an appropriate VSI distance with geodesic distance and normal variation. We show how the volumetric view on part separation addresses certain limitations of the surface view, which relies on concavity measures over a surface as implied by the well-known minima rule. We demonstrate how the new metric can be effectively utilized in various applications including mesh segmentation, shape registration, part-aware sampling and shape retrieval.

- title: Tangential Distance Field for Mesh Silhouette Analysis
  image: tangentialdis.png
  description: We consider a tangent-space representation of surfaces that maps each point on a surface to the tangent plane of the surface at that point. Such representations are known to facilitate the solution of several visibility problems, in particular, those involving silhouette analysis. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of distance fields for a given surface defined by its tangent planes. At each point in space, we assign a scalar value which is a weighted sum of distances to these tangent planes. We call the resulting scalar field a ‘tangential distance field’ (TDF). When applied to triangle mesh models, the tangent planes become supporting planes of the mesh triangles. The weighting scheme used to construct a TDF for a given mesh and the way the TDF is utilized can be closely tailored to a specific application. At the same time, the TDFs are continuous, lending themselves to standard optimization techniques such as greedy local search, thus leading to efficient algorithms. In this paper, we use four applications to illustrate the benefit of using TDFs&#58; multi-origin silhouette extraction in Hough space, silhouette-based view point selection, camera path planning and light source placement.

  description: We extend the single relaxation time lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) to the 3D body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. We show that the D3bQ15 lattice defined by a 15 neighborhood connectivity of the BCC lattice is not only capable of more accurately discretizing the velocity space of the continuous Boltzmann equation as compared to the D3Q15 Cartesian lattice, it also achieves a comparable spatial discretization with 30 percent less samples. We validate the accuracy of our proposed lattice by investigating its performance on the 3D lid-driven cavity flow problem and show that the D3bQ15 lattice offers significant cost savings while maintaining a comparable accuracy. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method and the impact on graphics and visualization techniques via the application of line-integral convolution on 2D slices as well as the extraction of streamlines of the 3D flow. We further study the benefits of our proposed lattice by applying it to the problem of simulating smoke and show that the D3bQ15 lattice yields more detail and turbulence at a reduced computational cost.

- title: A tool to create illuminant and reflectance spectra for light-driven graphics and visualization
  image: illuminantspectra.png
  description: Full spectra allow the generation of a physically correct rendering of a scene under different lighting conditions. In this article we devise a tool to augment a palette of given lights and material reflectances with constructed spectra, yielding specified colors or spectral properties such as metamerism or objective color constancy. We utilize this to emphasize or hide parts of a scene by matching or differentiating colors under different illuminations. These color criteria are expressed as a quadratic programming problem, which may be solved with positivity constraints. Further, we characterize full spectra of lights, surfaces, and transmissive materials in an efficient linear subspace model by forming eigenvectors of sets of spectra and transform them to an intermediate space in which spectral interactions reduce to simple component-wise multiplications during rendering. The proposed method enhances the user's freedom in designing photo-realistic scenes and helps in creating expressive visualizations. A key application of our technique is to use specific spectral lighting to scale the visual complexity of a scene by controlling visibility of texture details in surface graphics or material details in volume rendering.

We first describe a generalized physically-based reflectance model that relates the distribution of surface normals inside each pixel area to its reflectance function. The distribution of surface normals can be computed from the reflectance functions recorded in photometric stereo images. A convexity measure of subpixel geometry structure is also recovered at each pixel, through an analysis of brightness attenuation due to shadowing. Then, we use the recovered distribution of surface normals and the surface convexity to infer subpixel geometric structures on a surface of homogeneous material by spatially arranging the normals among pixels at a higher resolution than that of the input image

This framework can be applied to several widely used parametric reflectance models and can be implemented in graphics hardware for real-time processing, using a presented hardware-accelerated technique for non-linear filtering of mixture model parameters.

- title: Non-Rigid Spectral Correspondence of Triangle Meshes
  image: 
  description:  We present an algorithm for finding a meaningful vertex-to-vertex correspondence between two triangle meshes, which is designed to handle general non-rigid transformations. Our algorithm operates on embeddings of the two shapes in the spectral domain so as to normalize them with respect to uniform scaling and rigid-body transformation. Invariance to shape bending is achieved by relying on approximate geodesic point proximities on a mesh to capture its shape. To deal with moderate stretching, we first raise the issue of “eigenmode switching” and discuss heuristics to bring the eigenmodes to alignment. For additional non-rigid discrepancies in the spectral embeddings, we propose to use non-rigid alignment via thin-plate splines. This is combined with a refinement step based on geodesic proximities to improve dense correspondence. We show empirically that our algorithm outperforms previous spectral methods, as well as schemes that compute correspondence in the spatial domain via non-rigid iterative closest points or the use of local shape descriptors, e.g., 3D shape context. Finally, to speed up our algorithm, we examine the effect of using subsampling and Nystrom method.

As invariance to facial expressions holds the key to improving recognition performance, we propose to train for the component-wise weights to be applied to each individual attribute, as well as the weights used to combine the attributes, in order to adapt to expression variations. Using the eigenface approach based on the training results and a nearest neighbor classifier, we report recognition results on the expression-rich GavabDB face database and the well-known Notre Dame FRGC 3D database. We also perform a cross validation between the two databases.

For many design problems, design decisions are determined by the consequences of the design rather than its elemental parts. To support this need, the explorer is constructed to make the designer aware of design-level options, provide a structured context for design, and provide feedback on the consequences of design decisions. We argue that this approach encourages the designer to consider a wider variety of designs, which will lead to more effective designs overall. In a qualitative study, experiment designers using the explorer were found to consider a wider variety of designs and more designs overall than they reported considering in their normal practice.

- title: Image-based Plant Modeling 
  image: quan_06_tog.PNG
  description: In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic technique for modeling plants directly from images. Our image-based approach has the distinct advantage that the resulting model inherits the realistic shape and complexity of a real plant. We designed our modeling system to be interactive, automating the process of shape recovery while relying on the user to provide simple hints on segmentation. Segmentation is performed in both image and 3D spaces, allowing the user to easily visualize its effect immediately

- title: Separation of Highlight Reflections from Textured Surfaces
  image: tan_06_cvpr.PNG
  description: We present a method for separating highlight reflections on textured surfaces. In contrast to previous techniques that use diffuse color information from outside the highlight area to constrain the solution, the proposed method further capitalizes on the spatial distributions of colors to resolve ambiguities in separation that often arise in real images. For highlight pixels in which a clear-cut separation cannot be determined from color space analysis, we evaluate possible separation solutions based on their consistency with diffuse texture characteristics outside the highlight

- title: Resolution-Enhanced Photometric Stereo
  image: tan_06_eccv.PNG
  description: In this work, we propose a technique for resolution-enhanced photometric stereo, in which surface geometry is computed at a resolution higher than that of the input images. To achieve this goal, our method first utilizes a generalized reflectance model to recover the distribution of surface normals inside each pixel. This normal distribution is then used to infer sub-pixel structures on a surface of uniform material by spatially arranging the normals among pixels at a higher resolution according to a minimum description length criterion on 3D textons over the surface

- title: A practical approach to Spectral Volume Rendering
  image: practitionalrendering.png
  description: To make a spectral representation of color practicable for volume rendering, a new low-dimensional subspace method is used to act as the carrier of spectral information. With that model, spectral light material interaction can be integrated into existing volume rendering methods at almost no penalty. In addition, slow rendering methods can profit from the new technique of postillumination-generating spectral images in real-time for arbitrary light spectra under a fixed viewpoint. Thus, the capability of spectral rendering to create distinct impressions of a scene under different lighting conditions is established as a method of real-time interaction.

- title: Robust 2{D} Shape Correspondence using Geodesic Shape Context
  image: robust2d.png
  description: We present a robust shape descriptor for points along a 2D contour, based on the curvature distribution collected over bins arranged geodesically along the contour. Convolution, binning and hysteresis thresholding of curvatures are applied to render the descriptor more robust against noise and non-rigid shape deformation. Once the shape descriptor is computed for every point or feature vertex of the two shapes to be matched, a one-to-one correspondence can be quickly established through best matching of the descriptors, aided by a proximity heuristic.

  description: In this paper we cast the problem of tomography in the realm of computer graphics. By using PBRT (physically based rendering toolkit) we create a scripting environment that simplifies the programming of tomography algorithms such as Maximum-Likelihood Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) or Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART, a deviant of ART).

We propose a software architecture that embeds the volume rendering pipeline by using object-oriented design patterns, layers, and the concept of a shared application state.

  description: We propose a hybrid particle and texture based approach for the visualization of time-dependent vector fields. The underlying space-time framework builds a dense vector field representation in a two-step process&#58; 1) particle-based forward integration of trajectories in spacetime for temporal coherence, and 2) texture-based convolution along another set of paths through the spacetime for spatially correlated patterns.

- title: Spatiotemporal-Chromatic Structure of Natural Scenes
  image: spatiotemporal.png
  description: We investigate the implications of a unified spatiotemporal-chromatic basis for compression and reconstruction of image sequences. Different adaptive methods (PCA and ICA) are applied to generate basis functions. While typically such bases with spatial and temporal extent are investigated in terms of their correspondence to human visual perception, here we are interested in their applicability to multimedia encoding. The performance of the extracted spatiotemporal-chromatic patch bases is evaluated in terms of quality of reconstruction with respect to their potential for data compression. The results discussed here are intended to provide another path towards perceptually-based encoding of visual data by examining the interplay of chromatic features with spatiotemporal ones in data reduction.

- title: Visualization in the Einstein Year 2005&#58; A Case Study on Explanatory and Illustrative Visualization of Relativity and Astrophysics
  image: einstein.gif
  description: In this application paper, we report on over fifteen years of experience with relativistic and astrophysical visualization, which has been culminating in a substantial engagement for visualization in the Einstein Year 2005 - the 100/sup th/ anniversary of Einstein's publications on special relativity, the photoelectric effect, and Brownian motion. This paper focuses on explanatory and illustrative visualizations used to communicate aspects of the difficult theories of special and general relativity, their geometric structure, and of the related fields of cosmology and astrophysics. We discuss visualization strategies, motivated by physics education and didactics of mathematics, and describe what kind of visualization methods have proven to be useful for different types of media, such as still images in popular-science magazines, film contributions to TV shows, oral presentations, or interactive museum installations.

- title: Texture-Based Visualization of Uncertainty in Flow Fields
  image: texturebasedvis.png
  description: We present two novel texture-based techniques to visualize uncertainty in time-dependent 2D flow fields. Both methods use semi-Lagrangian texture advection to show flow direction by streaklines and convey uncertainty by blurring these streaklines. The first approach applies a cross advection perpendicular to the flow direction. The second method employs isotropic diffusion that can be implemented by Gaussian filtering. Both methods are derived from a generic filtering process that is incorporated into the traditional texture advection pipeline. Our visualization methods allow for a continuous change of the density of flow representation by adapting the density of particle injection. All methods can be mapped to efficient GPU implementations. Therefore, the user can interactively control all important characteristics of the system like particle density, error influence, or dye injection to create meaningful illustrations of the underlying uncertainty. Even though there are many sources of uncertainties, we focus on uncertainty that occurs during data acquisition. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methods for the example of real-world fluid flow data measured with the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Furthermore, we compare these techniques with an adapted multi-frequency noise approach.
