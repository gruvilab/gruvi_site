  headline: Jaime's Sucessful Msc Thesis Defense
  text: Congrats to Jaime for successfully defending his MSC thesis on "Towards Learning of a Joint Geometry-Structure Manifold for Shape Exploration".<br /><br /> Here is the abstract of his thesis.<br /><br /> We present a first attempt at producing a continuous generative model of 3D objects from a joint representation that incorporates the discrete structural variability as well as the continuous geometric variability that are often present in collections of man-made shapes. Starting from a set of compatibly segmented shapes, our main contribution consists in demonstrating the construction of the joint representation. Then, by using Gaussian Process learning to produce a predictive manifold from the joint representation, we investigate its capabilities and limitations for reproducing and synthesizing new shapes.

  headline: Warunika's Successful Msc Thesis Defense
  text: Congrats to Warunika for successfully defending her MSc thesis on "ExquiMo&#58; An Exquisite Corpse Tool for Co-Creative 3D Shape Modeling". The researchers&nbsp;would like to assure you that no person, dog, or any other animals were killed as the result of conducting this thesis research.<br /><br /> Here is the abstract of her work:<br /><br /> We introduce a shape modeling tool, ExquiMo, which is guided by the idea of improving the creativity of 3D shape designs through collaboration. Inspired by the game of Exquisite Corpse, our tool allocates distinct parts of a shape to multiple players who model the assigned parts in a sequence. Our approach is motivated by the understanding that effective surprise leads to creative outcomes. Hence, to maintain the surprise factor of the output, we conceal the previously modeled parts from the most recent player. Part designs from individual players are fused together to produce an often unexpected, hence creative, end result. We demonstrate the effectiveness of collaborative modeling for both man-made and natural shapes. Our results show that, when compared to models designed by individual users, multi-user collaborative modeling via ExquiMo tends to lead to more creative designs in terms of the most common criteria used to identify creative artifacts.
